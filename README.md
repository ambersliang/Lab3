# Web Dev Starter Code

## Overview

This lab demonstrates the basics of CSS rules and reviews our understanding of concepts from CS208. Given an example webpage, we test our knowledge by seeing how well we can replicate the webpage design using the provided reading resources, striving to match the design without relying on outside sources.

## Running the Webpage

The webpage can be run using the VSCode plugin "Live Preview" to view it on its development server.
